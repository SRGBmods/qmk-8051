# QMK for 8051


This is a fork of [VIAL QMK](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk)(which is a fork of the famous [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)). 

This project contains some small tweaks for supporting **8051** architech.  

Why supporting these dinosaurs? Haven't they gone extinct in the wild already?  
Kind of. But! I see a ton of cheap chinese keyboards still using 8051, with dead simple firmwares. This project can open a whole new world for them.  

Currently, any keyboards using **HFD801KJC** (clone of CH555 - a variant of 8051) can use this code. Because all HFD801KJC keyboards I've seen so far have exactly same hardware/software, just differnt keymap.  
With some tiny edits from my test keyboard [Reccarz kw75s](/keyboards/reccarz/kw75s), you're good to go. 

>[!CAUTION]
> This project is **experimental**.  
> - You might brick your keyboard. I'm not responsible for any damage you would do using this software.

## I. What works and what not

The translation from AVR/ARM to 8051, or more precisely, from **GCC** to **SDCC** compiler, is not without some serious hassle.
A lot of functions are untested, or not working (yet), I hope I can find a way to solve over time.
- [X] Common functions should works, I tested layers, CapWords and ConsumerKey.  
- [x] Encoder.  
- [x] NKRO.  
- [x] MouseKey.   
- [x] :warning:Console    : not working, I'm using UART for debugging.  

- [ ] **Vial**                : not working, cannot even enumerate USB device. debuggin...
- [x] :warning:CH555 USB stack: work OK enough. But dead simple.  
I tweak the sample code from CH555's Manufacturer(WCH) a bit to make it work with QMK.  
Definitely need some refactoring.
- [x] :warning:SCAN matrix: might need optimization.  
QMK use pointer for accessing GPIO. However, for 8051, pointer cannot be used to access peripheral registers.  
My work-around introduces some delay, but I'm not sure if it affects the scan time or not.  
- [ ] LED matrix : untested, but 8051 is probably too slow for that.  
For HFD801KJC keyboards, they have built-in LED matrix hardware, I might write driver for it later.  
- [ ] Bluetooth  : untested.  
All HFD801KJC keyboards I know comes with HS6620B BLE module.  
I recorded the whole MCU-BLE communication and definitely will cover bluetooth in the future.  
- [ ] EEPROM     : transient EEPROM works, but might need some optimization.  
I got a bunch of compiler `warning 88: cast of LITERAL value to 'generic' pointer`.   
Also, CH555 don't have EEPROM, might need to implement wear-leveling driver first.  

- [ ] One important feature of GCC that QMK uses frequently, but SDCC doesn't have is `__attribute((weak))`.  
So, if you write custom functions in your keymap.c, the ones end with `*_user`, you need to delete its corresponding definition in the QMK source code.   
Similarly, if use custom matrix scan routine, or some other custom driver, you also need to delete its correspoinding definition in QMK.   

- [ ] And various other untested QMK features.

## II. How to use

### 1. Setup

Besides cloning this repo and run `qmk setup`,  you need [SDCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc/files/) version **4.4.0** or above.  

### 2. Make your keymap

The port definition of 8051 is not *A1, A2, B1, B2, B3,*... but *P0_1, P0_2,*...
So, instead of:
```json
    "bootloader": "caterina",
    "processor": "atmega32u4",
    "matrix_pins": {
        "cols": ["C14", "C15", "A0", "A1", "A9", "H3"],
        "rows": ["B4", "B3", "A15", "A14"]
    },
```
Use this:
```json
    "bootloader": "ch55xbl",
    "processor": "ch555",
    "matrix_pins": {
        "cols": ["PORT0_1", "PORT1_2", "PORT3_0", "PORT0_3"],
        "rows": ["PORT1_1", "PORT1_7", "PORT3_3"]
    },
```
Standard 8051 MCU has 4 ports, from 0 -> 3. Other variants might differ. Each port have maximum 8 pins, from 0 -> 7.

Other than this, just do as you always do for AVR/ARM.

### 3. Then compile

I suck at reading and modifying makefiles. After spending a weak try to modify QMK's build system, I gave up (Help me pls :smile:).  
For now, at the QMK directory:
```bash
qmk compile -kb <your_keyboard> -km <your_keymap>
```
You will see an Error at the final message, when linking.  
But that's alright, ignore it. I wrote a simple script for temporarily replace this final link step:
```bash
./compile.sh <your_keyboard> <your_keymap>
```
The result is a .hex and a .bin file at QMK directory. You can now use it for flashing.
 




## III. Supported Keyboards

* **CH55x**:
    - **HFD801KJC** (clone of CH555):
        - [x] [Reccarz kw75s](/keyboards/reccarz/kw75s)  
        - [x] :warning:**UNTESTED**, should works. Any other keyboard using HFD801KJC, known ones: QK60 RGB, GMK67, James Donkey A3
    - **VS11K28A** (also clone of CH555), but I'm not sure about the Bootloader situation of this one:
        - [ ] Some GMMK, Redragon, Womier, Akko keyboards.

* **SinoWealth** MCUs and its innumberable variants/clones: **UNSUPPORTED**. 
    The number of keyboards using this MCU family is so many, I don't even bother naming them. If your keyboard not using QMK or CH555, ~90% chance it is SinoWealth.
    - [ ] **SH68F90** (the original one), **BYK916**(its most common clone).  
    - [ ] **BYK8xx,BYK9xx,**... (its variants).  
  The bootloader of these MCUs is much easier to brick than CH555. Some links if you're still interested:

>[!NOTE]
> With only 1kB xRAM, QMK for **CH552** is just **not possible**, unfortunately.

### 1. For keyboards using HFD801KJC MCU

>[!CAUTION]
> This cannot be applied for **VS11K28A**, even though they're also CH555.
> Because keyboards with VS11K28A uses different hardware configurations than **HFD801KJC**.

>[!CAUTION]
> There is no way to backup or reflash the original firmware.  
> Once you install QMK, this is it. You can reflash QMK, or any other firmware. Just not the original.

>[!WARNING] 
> - Bluetooth and LED matrix is not working.  
> - The program is now pretty buggy. Sometimes it works fine for days.
>   Sometimes it just hangs randomly, a Reset is needed for it to be working again.

#### a. About the hardware

All HFD801KJC keyboards seems using this same hardware configuration:  
- P0_0->P0_7, P3_2->P3_7, P7_0->P7_1: column pins for scan matrix / common anode pins for LED matrix.  
- PORT4: row pins for scan matrix / cathode pins for LED matrix - RED color.  
- PORT2: cathode pins for LED matrix - GREEN color.  
- PORT1: cathode pins for LED matrix - BLUE color.  

- PIN P3_0 & P3_1: UART0 - connect to BLE module.
  
Specific cordinate for each key depends on the keyboards. You can totaly just flash the firmware of kw75s, then make some guesses. A multimeter might not even needed.  

#### b. About the software

There are **two bootloader** in HFD801KJC:
- The **factory bootloader**, installed by the manufacturer of the MCU itself. This one have some built-in protection & securities, very hard to kill, so don't worry.  
- The **OEM bootloader**, installed by the keyboard PCB maker.  

On powers up reset (when you plugin the cable/battery):
1. It enters the *factory bootloader* at address 0xF400.
2. If ***P1_5*** held to GND, it stays in *factory bootloader* mode, and appears as a USB Device with *PID:VID* is *0x4348:0x55E0*. Then wait for flashing.  
3. If not, the MCU apply software reset, then start running from address 0x0000. From there, it jumps directly to the *OEM bootloader*.
4. If ***P4_7*** held to GND, it stays in *OEM bootloader*, appear as another *PID:VID*.   
>[!NOTE]
> **OEM** bootloader uses **different** flashing protocol than the **factory** one.  
5. If not, it jumps to main code, and the keyboard runs normally.  

As you might already guessed, to flash QMK, we'll just use the MCU's *factory bootloader* (and destroy the *OEM bootloader + OEM firmware* in the process).   
>[!TIP]
> **How to get into the factory bootloader**  
> There should be 3 or 4 holes near the MCU.  
> - Try sorting twos of those holes while connecting the USB cable.  
> - At the same time, observe the VID:PID to find out which holes gives you the *factory bootloader*.   

You can use the Flash tool from the Manufacturer of CH555 - [WCHISPStudio](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) or various other open source tools on github.   
Flashing the compiled QMK .bin (or .hex) file should be easy. So I don't mention it.   
>[!IMPORTANT]
> Whatever Flash tool you use, remember to uncheck the option ***"Enable P7.1 as manual reset input pin."***   
> Since P7.1 belongs to scan matrix, you don't want the keyboard to randomly reset while typing.   

#### c. Memory usage

As I tested, QMK consumes about **3kB xRAM** & **50kB Flash** on CH555. Almost **3 times** the usage comparing to AVR.  
The ancient 8051 clearly don't like modern C code. Combines with sdcc and no LTO. We have a big ass room for optimization here.  

>[!TIP] 
> You can try [sdcc_MCS51_rm](https://github.com/vuhuycan/sdcc_MCS51_rm), a dead code optimization tool for 8051-sdcc.  
> It can bring memory consumption down to **2kB xRAM** & **30kB Flash** on CH555. 
> To do that, run `./lto.sh <kb> <km>`  before running `./compile.sh <kb> <km>`.  


#### d. Performance

For normal typing, I don't see any delay. Not tested anything yet, but with F_CPU=12MHz & no console, I guess respond time is probably less than 20ms at worse.

# For further development

## How I ported QMK to SDCC/MCS51

### Modify the source code

Basically, just wrote some lower level drivers for mcs51 + ch555, some tweak here and there for complying SDCC syntax, and voila. We have QMK for 8051, if not couting the half broken build system.
- [keyboards/](/keyboards/)   <- keymaps, configs for your keyboards lives here.
- [quantum/](/quantum/)       <- QMK juicy features lives here. Most SDCC unsupported C/GCC syntax also lives here.
- [tmk_core/protocol/](/tmk_core/protocol/)   <- USB stacks
    - [usb_descriptor.c](/tmk_core/protocol/usb_descriptor.c) <- common usb descriptors for all stacks.
    - [lufa/](/tmk_core/protocol/lufa/)    <- for AVRs
    - [chibios/](/tmk_core/protocol/lufa/) <- for ARMs
    - [ch555/](/tmk_core/protocol/ch555/)  <- for MCS51-CH555 - **NEW**  
- [platforms/](/platforms/) <- other important lower level drivers
    - [gpio.h](/platforms/gpio.h)
    - [timer.h](/platforms/timer.h)
    - [bootloader.h](/platforms/bootloader.h), [suspend.h](/platforms/suspend.h), [atomic_util.h](/platforms/atomic_util.h)
    - [avr/](/platforms/avr/) <- contain `.c` implementation of above `headers`, for AVR.
    - [chibios/](/platforms/chibios/) <- for ARM.
    - [mcs51/](/platforms/mcs51/) <- for MCS51 - **NEW** 
- [lib/](/lib/) <- contain submodules of specific architech/device.
    - [lufa/](/lib/lufa/)
    - [chibios/](/lib/chibios/)
    - [ch555/](/lib/ch555/) <- for MCS51-CH555 - **NEW** 
- [drivers](/drivers/) <- contain other peripheral drivers, like eeprom, wear-leveling, lcd, led, bluetooth,...

### Modify the build system

- [data/](/data/) and [lib/python/qmk/](/lib/python/qmk/) <- convert `info.json` to C sources and headers before compile. **MODIFIED** to add CH555
- [builddefs/](/builddefs/) 
    - [build_keyboard.mk](/builddefs/build_keyboard.mk) <- this is called first when build. It includes other .mk files.   
    - [build_features.mk](/builddefs/build_features.mk) <- convert `rules.mk` to C sources and headers before compile.
    - [common_rules.mk](/builddefs/common_rules.mk)   <- contain main build rules, actual compile, link commands. **MODIFIED** for supporting SDCC. The main reason I cannot make it works for SDCC is because the extension name of SDCC object file is `.rel` instead of `.o` like GCC.
- [platforms/mcs51/platform.mk](/platforms/mcs51/platform.mk)      <- includes source files for MCS51 architech. **NEW** 
- [tmk_core/protocol/ch555/ch555.mk](/tmk_core/protocol/ch555/ch555.mk) <- includes source files for CH555 device. **NEW** 

When you run `qmk compile`, the execution procedure looks something like this:
1. `build_keyboard.mk` run first.
2. It then call `build_features.mk` and scripts in `data + lib/python/qmk` to convert your keymap & config to C sources and headers in `.build/obj_<kb>_<km>/src/`.
3. It then includes `.mk` for finding C sources & headers for correct drivers, platforms and usb protocol.
4. Compile & link.

## Possible problems during compile/link

- Internal RAM overflow because of **"sloc"** variables.  
  QMK uses `--large-model`, which means variables are put in xRAM. 
  However, when complex calculation is performed, especially when 16/32bit values are involved, 8 registers are not enough. SDCC will saves these values using **sloc** variables, and put them in iRAM instead of xRAM, for quick accessing time.  
  You can use this command `rg ';sloc' -t asm .build/obj_<kb>_<km>/` to check which functions using many **sloc** variables.
  So, if you're using too many QMK features, you'll get link time Error like this:
  ```bash
  ?ASlink-Error-Could not get <num> consecutive bytes in internal RAM for area <AREA_NAME>.
  ```
  Now, what you can do is:  
      - dissable the functions using many **sloc** variables.  
      - Use `#pragma` `nogcse`, `noinvariant` or `noinduction` to disable coressponding optimization feature. **sloc** dissapear with the cost of performace.
      - Use `#pragma stackauto` or `__reentrant` to put variables to stack instead of iRAM/xRAM. But this might cause stack overflow.  
      - Optimize the source code.
  
- SDCC cannot handle too long command line.  
  When using many QMK features, you might get a Weird Error like this:
  ```bash
  Compiling: .build/obj_reccarz_kw75s_vial/src/default_keyboard.c                                    sh: 1: in/../share/sdcc/include/mcs51: not found
  ```
  QMK build system produces alot of duplicates `-I` and `-D` arguments. I tried removing the duplicated ones, it compiles.
  

- For some unknow reason, sometimes, I got **BIT_BANK** related ***Error*** during link:  
  ```bash
  ?ASlink-Error-Could not get 1 consecutive byte in internal RAM for area BIT_BANK.
  ```
  I don't know why SDCC decides to preserve a byte for **BIT_BANK**, or what even BIT_BANK is. Anyone know about this BIT_BANK thing, please help me :face_with_spiral_eyes:.  
  I know it got something to do with the CH555 USB's interrupt service routine. But don't see that byte used anywhere in the code.  
  So, my script above just removes the BIT_BANK byte in the USB interrupt assembly code, Re-assemble then Link. Haven't seen a problem so far :crossed_fingers:. 

- Use struct/union as function return type break the returned variable's value.  
  I think it's a compiler bug of v4.3.x, not sure about 4.4.0. Or maybe some big struct/union are causing stack overflow.  
  I have encounter another similar problem at v4.3.0 but dissapeared in v4.3.6. Using struct/union as function param corrupts the passed variable's value.  

- SDCC does not support compound literal.  
  `struct report_t report = {.a ={0}, .b ={0}};` is supported. But `struct report_t report = {struct report_t}{0};` is not.  
  It's strange, it's a standard C syntax, but SDCC does not support.

- Many GCC specific syntax are not supported by SDCC, obviously.  
  For ex: `typeof`, `__attribute`,... But most cumbersome is `switch` `case LOW ... HIGH:`, converting all of them to `if` `else` is time consuming.  
  Luckily, SDCC does add support for many other GCC syntax recently, like `#pragma once`, `__COUNTER__`, `__has_include_next`,...  

## Some notes about MCS51's Memory model

### A Mesozoic Era Memory model

- MCS51 was developed in the 80s, when memory usage was counted by just Bytes, kBytes of memories was mind blowing big. So iRAM is equivalent to RAM nowadays. xRAM is treated more like EEPROM or Flash, rather than actual RAM.  
  As the result, MCS51 have a complicated memory system; with two RAM areas, one SFR area and one CODE area:  
  - CODE - use 16bit address, store machine codes.  
  - xRAM - use 16bit address(max *64kB* theorically, but usually *< 8kB*), store variables.  
  - iRAM - use **8 bit** address(*256Bytes* in most MCUs nowadays), store registers, variables, stack.  
  - SFRs - use **8 bit** address, store system control & peripheral registers.  
  
  Data exchange between iRAM and Registers can be direct or indirect.  
  Data exchange between xRAM and Registers can only be perform indirectly though the tiny DPTR register.  
  - xRAM is slow, but big.  
  - iRAM is fast, but tiny.
    
  Even worse, only lowwer 128B of iRAM can be access directly/indirectly by `mov Rn,Rn` or `mov Rn,@Ri` instructions.  
  At upper 128B of iRAM: 
  - Indirect access gives you the iRAM normally.  
  - Direct access gives you the SFR, not the iRAM.   
    Athough SFRs use the same address space as upper half 128B of iRAM, iRAM and SFRs are not the same. They are completely different, physically separated.    

  QMK couldn't fit in iRAM for sure. Even if it does, there would be no place left for stack.   
  So we are stuck with the shitty xRAM.

| Memory Space  | Size                                 | Access method |Pointer size|              
| -----------   | -----------                          |----------     |  --------- |      
| __data/__idata| 128B-lower addr of idata <p> **these are physically same**   |mov  Rn,@Ri <p> mov Rn, Rn|  1Bbyte     |
| __idata       | 128B-upper addr of idata             |mov  Rn,@Ri    |    1Byte      |
| __sfr         | 128B-upper of idata <p> **physically separated from idata**  |mov  Rn, Rn               | **none**|
|               |                                      |               |            |  
| __xdata       | 64kB  max                            |movx A ,@DPTR  |    2Bytes      |
| __pdata       | 256B-1stPage of xdata                |movx A ,@Ri    |    2Bytes      |
|               |                                      |               |            |  
| __code        | 64kB max                             |movc A, @DPTR  |    2Bytes      |


- Pointer destination can affect memory usage & performance. Pointer pointing to __idata/__data is 1 byte, to __xdata/__code is 2 byes, to unknown region (generic pointer) is 3 bytes. You probably want to specify the pointer destination for critical ones.

Read more about mcs51 memory at [8051 Memory Spaces](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/wiki/8051-Memory-Spaces)

- Stack size: stack of mcs51 is put in iRAM, thus in theory, we have max 256B for stack. But some of the lowwer 128B is used for Register Banks and other critical variables. Actual size is less than 200B. For QMK, it is only ~160B. 
- Local variable behaves like static variable by default. Instead of putting local variable in stack like other architech, SDCC put it in .DATA segment, as the result, local variable in SDCC-mcs51 behaves like static variable. This is a waste of precious memory for rarely used functions.
  To put it in stack, we can use `#pragma stackauto` or `__reentrant`. But beware of putting big variables on the stack. It can causes stack overflow easily. [8051 Even More stack](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/wiki/8051-Even-More-Stack)

### Hardware improvements on MCS51 modern variants
  
- Dual DPTR, decrementing DPTR, auto incrementing DPTR. These features of modern day 8051 variants can greatly improve memory access, by releaving the DPTR bottleneck.
  Though SDCC does support dual DPTR for DS390, an old 8051 variant, nobody uses it nowadays. Let's hope SDCC support this feature for MCS51 someday.
